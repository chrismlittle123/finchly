This is the killer insight. Let me articulate it back:

## The Core Product Truth

**Finchly doesn't ask you to report. It asks you to fill in the gaps.**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│   WHAT FINCHLY ALREADY KNOWS              WHAT FINCHLY ASKS     │
│   (from connected systems)                (the gaps)            │
│                                                                 │
│   ✓ 12 commits merged this week           "Why did you pivot   │
│   ✓ 3 PRs still open                       to the new API?"    │
│   ✓ Linear: 8 tasks done, 2 blocked                            │
│   ✓ Notion: spec doc updated Tues         "What's blocking     │
│   ✓ Meet: 3 syncs with design team         the auth task?"     │
│                                                                 │
│   ✓ Figma: 4 screens changed              "How's the team      │
│   ✓ Slack: active in #proj-atlas           feeling about       │
│                                             the deadline?"      │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The check-in is 3 minutes, not 15**, because Finchly already did the homework.

## The Accountability Layer

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The pressure is visible but not aggressive.** Everyone knows the deadline. Finchly helps you hit it. If you don't, it's on you — not because you were nagged, but because you chose not to.

## The Psychology

| Old way (status meetings) | Finchly way |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| "Tell me everything" | "Tell me what I can't see" |
| Feels like surveillance | Feels like assistance |
| Takes 15-30 min | Takes 3-4 min |
| Easy to BS | Hard to BS (Finchly has the data) |
| Accountability is in the meeting | Accountability is async + visible |
| Manager chases you | Finchly finds the right moment |

```

**3 questions. Not 10.** Because Finchly already knows the rest.

---

## The Notification Updates

| Context | Notification |
|---------|--------------|
| Gaps detected, good time | "3 quick questions about Atlas — got 3 min?" |
| Deadline approaching | "Atlas update due by 6pm. I just need 2 things." |
| No gaps, just confirm | "Atlas looks on track. Quick confirm and you're done." |
| All caught up | "Nothing needed from you today. 🪺" |

---

## What Makes This Different

| Other tools | Finchly |
|-------------|---------|
| Ask for status | Ask for **gaps** |
| Same questions every time | **Adaptive** questions based on data |
| Manual reminders | **Smart timing** (finds your free moments) |
| No accountability | **Visible accountability** (CEO dashboard) |
| Typing or meetings | **Voice-first**, text if preferred |
| You do all the work | Finchly does the homework, you fill in gaps |

---

## The Tagline + Positioning

**Finchly: Build nests of knowledge. From anywhere.**

**Supporting:**
- "Give 3-minute updates, not 30-minute meetings."
- "Finchly asks what it can't figure out. You fill in the gaps."
- "Accountability without micromanagement."

---

## The Pieces

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Integrations** | GitHub, Linear, Notion, Figma, Google Meet, Slack, Calendar |
| **Gap Detection Engine** | Compares what's known vs. what's missing |
| **Question Generator** | Creates adaptive, context-aware prompts |
| **Mac Agent** | Detects availability windows |
| **iOS App** | Notifications + voice/text check-in |
| **CEO Dashboard** | Who's updated, who hasn't, project health |
| **Knowledge Base (Nests)** | Stores everything, queryable |

---

Want me to:
1. **Design the CEO dashboard** in detail?
2. **Map the gap detection logic** (what systems feed in, how gaps are identified)?
3. **Create a unified Finchly architecture diagram** that combines the original + this new layer?
