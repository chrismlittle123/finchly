# Brief MVP: Two Week Build

## What It Is

A voice agent that asks your team a fixed set of questions, transcribes their answers, generates a report, and saves it to Notion.

**That's it.** No integrations. No smart questions. No dashboards. Just voice → report → Notion.

---

## The Pitch

> "Talk through your update in 5 minutes. Brief writes the report and puts it in Notion."
>
> No typing. No forms. Just talk.

## Features

### 1. Question Template
Fixed questions based on your template. Example:

```
1. What did you work on this week?
2. What's your progress percentage? (0-100%)
3. Are you on track for your deadline?
4. Any blockers or challenges?
5. What's planned for next week?
6. Anything else to flag?
```

No AI-generated questions. Just the template, asked verbally.

### 2. Voice Agent
- User clicks a link or Slack button to start
- Agent asks each question one by one
- User speaks their answer
- Agent transcribes and moves to next question
- ~5 minutes total

### 3. Report Generation
After all questions answered:
- Claude formats responses into a clean markdown report
- Includes: summary, status, blockers, next steps
- Structured and readable

### 4. Notion Export
- Report saved as a new Notion page
- In a designated "Weekly Updates" database
- Tagged with person name and date

## NOT in MVP

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Linear/GitHub integration | V2 — no repo connections for now |
| Gap detection / smart questions | V2 — fixed template only |
| Slack channel posting | V2 — just Notion output |
| Dashboard | V2 — view reports in Notion |
| Multiple templates | V2 — one template hardcoded |
| Team rollup / digest | V2 — individual reports only |

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| **Voice** | LiveKit Agents (or Vapi) |
| **Backend** | Next.js API routes |
| **LLM** | Claude API (report generation) |
| **Output** | Notion API |
| **Hosting** | Vercel |
| **Trigger** | Slack button or direct link |

Minimal stack. No database needed for MVP (Notion is the database).

---

## User Flow

```
1. User receives Slack DM: "Time for your weekly update"
   [🎙️ Start Voice Update]

2. User clicks → opens voice session

3. Agent: "Hey! Let's do your weekly update. What did you work on this week?"
   User: [speaks for 30-60 seconds]

4. Agent: "Got it. What's your progress percentage?"
   User: "About 75%"

5. Agent: "Are you on track for the deadline?"
   User: "Yeah, should be done by Friday"

6. Agent: "Any blockers?"
   User: "Waiting on API credentials from the vendor"

7. Agent: "What's planned for next week?"
   User: [speaks]

8. Agent: "Anything else to flag?"
   User: "Nope, that's it"

9. Agent: "Great, I'll write up your report and save it to Notion. Done!"

10. Report appears in Notion database
```

Total time: ~5 minutes of talking.

## Notion Setup

### Database Structure
Create a Notion database called "Weekly Updates" with:

| Property | Type |

| Person | Select or Person |
| Week Of | Date |
| Status | Select (On Track / At Risk / Blocked) |
| Progress | Number (%) |
| Created | Created time |

### API Integration
- Create Notion integration
- Share database with integration
- Use Notion API to create pages

---

## API Routes

```
POST /api/slack/interactions  -- Handle "Start Update" button click

POST /api/voice/session       -- Create LiveKit session
POST /api/voice/complete      -- Called when voice session ends

POST /api/report/generate     -- Generate markdown from transcript
POST /api/notion/save         -- Save report to Notion
```

---

## Voice Agent Script

```typescript
const questions = [
  {
    id: 'work_done',
    ask: "What did you work on this week?",
    followUp: "Got it.",
  },
  {
    id: 'progress',
    ask: "What's your progress percentage? Just give me a number.",
    followUp: "Thanks.",
  },
  {
    id: 'on_track',
    ask: "Are you on track for your deadline?",
    followUp: "Okay.",
  },
  {
    id: 'blockers',
    ask: "Any blockers or challenges I should know about?",
    followUp: "Noted.",
  },
  {
    id: 'next_week',
    ask: "What's planned for next week?",
    followUp: "Sounds good.",
  },
  {
    id: 'other',
    ask: "Anything else you want to flag?",
    followUp: null,  // End of questions
  },
];

// Agent flow:
// 1. Greet user
// 2. For each question: ask → wait for response → transcribe → acknowledge
// 3. Thank user, end session
// 4. Trigger report generation
```

---

## Slack Integration (Trigger Only)

Just need a way to trigger the voice session:

### Option A: Scheduled DM
```
📊 Weekly Update Time

Ready to give your update? Takes about 5 minutes.

[🎙️ Start Voice Update]
```

Button opens the voice session in browser.

### Option B: Slash Command
```
/brief
```

Returns a link to start the voice session.

---

## Two Week Timeline

### Week 1: Voice + Transcription
- [ ] Set up LiveKit (or Vapi) account
- [ ] Create voice agent with question script
- [ ] Test full question flow
- [ ] Capture and store transcripts
- [ ] Verify: can complete a voice session and get transcript

### Week 2: Report + Notion
- [ ] Build report generation prompt (Claude)
- [ ] Generate clean markdown from transcript
- [ ] Set up Notion integration
- [ ] Save reports to Notion database
- [ ] Add Slack trigger (button or /brief command)
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow
- [ ] Demo prep

---

## Demo Script

1. **Show Slack** — "I get a message asking for my update"
2. **Click button** — Opens voice session
3. **Talk through it** — Answer 6 questions (~3 min)
4. **Done** — "Brief says it's writing my report"
5. **Open Notion** — Report is there, formatted nicely
6. **The value** — "I talked for 3 minutes. No typing. Report is done."

---

## Success Criteria

Someone finishes an update and says:

> "That was way easier than writing it myself."

A manager opens Notion and says:

> "I can see everyone's updates in one place."

That's the MVP.
