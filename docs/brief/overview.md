# Brief: Product Overview

## The Core Insight

**Brief doesn't ask you to report. It asks you to fill in the gaps.**

**The check-in is 3 minutes, not 15**, because Brief already did the homework.

## The Tagline

**"Fill in the gaps, not reports."**

Supporting messages:
- "Give 3-minute updates, not 30-minute meetings"
- "Accountability without micromanagement"
- "Ask less, know more"

---

## The Problem

Status meetings waste everyone's time:

| Pain Point | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| People report what tools already know | "I merged 12 PRs" — GitHub knows this |
| Same questions every week | "What did you work on?" — repetitive, generic |
| Easy to BS or ramble | No accountability, no data to verify |
| Managers chase updates | Slack pings, email follow-ups, meetings |
| Takes 15-30 minutes | Per person, per week — it adds up |

---

## The Solution

Brief pulls from your team's tools, identifies what it can't figure out, and asks only targeted questions.

### The Psychology

| Old way (status meetings) | Brief way |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| "Tell me everything" | "Tell me what I can't see" |
| Feels like surveillance | Feels like assistance |
| Takes 15-30 min | Takes 3-4 min |
| Easy to BS | Hard to BS (Brief has the data) |
| Accountability is in the meeting | Accountability is async + visible |
| Manager chases you | Brief finds the right moment |

---

## Integrations

Brief connects to your team's existing tools:

| Tool | What Brief Learns |
|------|-------------------|
| GitHub | Commits, PRs, reviews, merge activity |
| Linear | Tasks completed, blocked, in progress |
| Notion | Doc updates, page activity |
| Figma | Design changes, screen updates |
| Google Meet | Meeting frequency, attendees |
| Slack | Channel activity, collaboration patterns |
| Calendar | Availability, meeting load |

**The pressure is visible but not aggressive.** Everyone knows the deadline. Brief helps you hit it. If you don't, it's on you — not because you were nagged, but because you chose not to.

## Smart Notifications

| Context | Notification |
|---------|--------------|
| Gaps detected, good time | "3 quick questions about Atlas — got 3 min?" |
| Deadline approaching | "Atlas update due by 6pm. I just need 2 things." |
| No gaps, just confirm | "Atlas looks on track. Quick confirm and you're done." |
| All caught up | "Nothing needed from you today. ✓" |

Brief uses calendar and activity signals to find the right moment to prompt — not when you're in a meeting or deep in code.

---

## Key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Integrations** | GitHub, Linear, Notion, Figma, Google Meet, Slack, Calendar |
| **Gap Detection Engine** | Compares what's known vs. what's missing |
| **Question Generator** | Creates adaptive, context-aware prompts |
| **Mac Agent** | Detects availability windows |
| **iOS App** | Notifications + voice/text check-in |
| **Dashboard** | Who's updated, who hasn't, project health |

---

## What Makes Brief Different

| Other tools | Brief |
|-------------|-------|
| Ask for status | Ask for **gaps** |
| Same questions every time | **Adaptive** questions based on data |
| Manual reminders | **Smart timing** (finds your free moments) |
| No accountability | **Visible accountability** (dashboard) |
| Typing or meetings | **Voice-first**, text if preferred |
| You do all the work | Brief does the homework, you fill in gaps |

---

## Target Users

| Role | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Engineering Managers** | Know what's happening without chasing people |
| **CEOs / Founders** | Visibility across all projects, risk flags |
| **Team Leads** | Less time in status meetings, more time building |
| **Individual Contributors** | 3-minute updates instead of 30-minute meetings |

---

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Positioning |
|------------|-------------|
| Range | Daily standups, team rituals |
| Geekbot | Slack-based async standups |
| Friday | Goals and check-ins |
| Status meetings | The default (and the enemy) |

**Brief's edge:** We pull from tools and only ask what we can't figure out. Others just ask the same questions every time.
